+ Project summary:
In this project, we work together to explore two algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness: one algorithm is Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen) and another is Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS) [which refers to A4 and A6 in Piazza]. Based on the data, COMPAS with binary class label(y) and binary sensitive attribute (race), we evaluated accuracy and calibration.
